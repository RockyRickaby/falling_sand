# Falling Sand Simulator

This is a simple small little project. It's not exactly accurate when it comes to physics.

This was made following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4u7Zy_b868) with some parts adapted to work with Java. 

This project has no external dependencies.

## Building and running

Run these commands on the command line to build and then run this little simulator:
